Low Noise Moving-Coil Pre-Amplifier

## Purpose
Generic _standalone_ pre-preamp for **Moving Coil** phono cartridges, applying a fixed linear voltage gain.

## Design
The use of **four _common-base_ stages in parallel**  provides **low input impedance** (100 Ω) and **improved _signal-to-noise_ ratio** (by 6 dB).

## Specs
- **Power supply:** 9-12 V, asymmetrical (just a few mA)
- **Gain:** x33 (+34 dB)
- **Input Sensitivity:** 0.11 mV over 100 Ω (for a 3.6 mV output, suitable for [TuchAudio 103 preamp](../../../ta103))
- **Nominal Output level:** 3.6 mV over 110 kΩ (from a 0.11 mV input)
- **Output impedance:** 3.3 kΩ. _Lower load impedances are allowed, but diminished output level and impaired bass response are to be expected_.
